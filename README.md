# Flight System Which Uses MYSQL Database

In this project we made a flight system. Modules that we have listed below:

1. Login
2. Search Flight
3. Select Flight
4. Create Ticket 
5. Change Ticket
6. Online Check In

I used Netbeans for coding and for GUI we used Java Swing Library. For database, I used MYSQL Workbench and POPSQL. 

In database we have 13 tables. Table names listed below:

1. bilet
2. binis_karti
3. fiyat
4. havayolu
5. koltuk
6. kullanici
7. sinif
8. student
9. ucak
10. ucus
11. ucus_noktasi
12. yolcu
13. yolcu_tipi

You must import database files to your MYSQL Workbench and in [Connector.java](https://github.com/fzehracetin/flight-system-which-uses-mysql-database/blob/master/Connector.java) you must change the username and password to your own MYSQL account. The code files are little bit nasty so it can be more connectors in java classes you have to change them all to your own MYSQL username and password. Don't forget to add the [Java Connector](https://github.com/fzehracetin/flight-system-which-uses-mysql-database/blob/master/mysql-connector-java-8.0.15.jar) to your library. This is the key of the connection between MYSQL and Java.
